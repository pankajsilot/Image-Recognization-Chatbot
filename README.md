# 🧠 AI-Powered Image Recognition Chatbot 🤖🖼️

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Image Recognition Chatbot** – a smart web application that understands images and responds to user queries in natural language using the power of **Google Vision API** and **OpenAI ChatGPT**.

## 📸 What It Does

This chatbot allows users to:

- 🖼️ Upload an image (JPG, PNG)
- 💬 Ask a question or give a prompt about the image
- 🤖 Get an intelligent response based on what's in the image

It combines **computer vision** and **natural language processing** to simulate human-like understanding and explanation of images.
